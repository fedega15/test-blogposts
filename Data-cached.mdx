# Data cache
Next.js has a built-in Data Cache that persists the result of data fetches across incoming server requests and deployments. This is possible because Next.js extends the native fetch API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching semantics.By default, data requests that use fetch are cached. You can use the cache and next.revalidate options of fetch to configure the caching behavior.

## How the Data Cache Works

- The first time a fetch request is called during rendering, Next.js checks the Data Cache for a cached response.
- If a cached response is found, it's returned immediately and memoized.
- If a cached response is not found, the request is made to the data source, the result is stored in the Data Cache, and memoized.
- For uncached data , the result is always fetched from the data source, and memoized.
- Whether the data is cached or uncached, the requests are always memoized to avoid making duplicate requests for the same data during a React render pass.
